### Implementation of StringBuilder class of java

1. Java StringBuilder class is mutable sequence of characters. StringBuilder Class
can be comparable to String however the StringBuilder class provides more
versatility because of its modification features.
2. You are required to implement a library which supports following functionalities:

          1. Initialize a string ---- O(1)
          
          2. Append two string ---- O(1)
          
          3. Find substring in string ---- O(n) (used KMP algorithm for it)
